# survive_the_nut
## What we once thought to be our friend could turn out to be our greatest foe yet.
This mod is the third part of the _nut series of mods. It (currently) adds a pine nut golem that rarely spawns in forests (provided that I did it correctly), and will ruin your day. However, manage to kill it and you can claim its bounty of pine nuts, in addition to a few pinecones and a small mana crystal.

Also adds the pine nut titan, a massive creature that is passive until harmed. It very rarely spawns in forests, and it would be best not to attack it. It has extremely high health, armor, and attack, in addition to having regeneration. Slay the beast, however, and you will be able to claim its vast quatities of pine nuts.

The number of pine nuts you get probably isn't very balanced, but this thing isn't easy to kill. It's fast, tough, and hits relatively hard.

I'll probably add more pine nut abominations to this mod at some point.
