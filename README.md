# survive_the_nut
## What we once thought to be our friend could turn out to be our greatest foe yet.
This mod adds a pine nut golem that rarely spawns in forests (provided that I did it correctly), and will ruin your day. However, manage to kill it and you can claim its bounty of pine nuts, in addition to a few pinecones and a small mana crystal.

The number of pine nuts you get probably isn't very balanced, but this thing isn't easy to kill. It's fast, tough, and hits relatively hard.
