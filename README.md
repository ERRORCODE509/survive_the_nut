# survive_the_nut v1.3
## What we once thought to be our friend could turn out to be our greatest foe yet.
This mod is the third part of the _nut series of mods. Here are a few of the creatures added by this mod:

A pine nut golem that rarely spawns in forests (provided that I did it correctly), and will ruin your day. However, manage to kill it and you can claim its bounty of pine nuts, in addition to a few pinecones and a small mana crystal.

The pine nut titan, a massive creature that is passive until harmed. It very rarely spawns in forests, and it would be best not to attack it. It has extremely high health, armor, and attack, in addition to having regeneration. Slay the beast, however, and you will be able to claim its vast quatities of pine nuts.

A pine nut construct, a mass of pine nuts that is hostile on sight. Spawns in forests more frequently than the pine nut golem, but is still a bit rare. Much easier to kill than the previous to creatures, as its stats are only a bit better than a feral human, though it is much faster. As a result, gives much less pine nuts when butchered due to its reduced size and mass.

Check the wiki page of the GitHub for additional creatures and info.

More pine nut abominations are currently in the works.
